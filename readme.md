# Open Telemetry Java Application Instrumentation Workshop
This project is a lift-and-load of Adilson Somensari's demo from .conf21.  All instructional content is taken directly from the `readme` from his [original repo](https://github.com/asomensari-splunk/spring-petclinic).  All credit for this work is due to his efforts to make instrumenting the classic Java / Spring Boot application "Spring Pet Clinic" simple and easy.

The goal of this project is to form the core content of a workshop that can be run for customers to help them understand how to unlock the full power of Splunk Observability Cloud.

The original [Spring Pet Clinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) application is a canonical implementation of various features of the Spring Boot framework for Java applications.  The `readme` file from this project is included here as `./orginal-readme.md`
